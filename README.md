Generative AI Learning & Resource Hub

Your Go‑To Repository for Comprehensive Generative AI Guides, Tutorials, and Use Cases

<div align="center"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python‑AI‑learning‑blue"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License‑MIT‑blue"/> </div>
🌟 Overview

This repository is designed to be an end‑to‑end learning hub for Generative AI (GenAI) — covering foundational concepts, hands‑on use cases, tools, and practical projects. It’s crafted for developers, students, and AI practitioners who want to go from GenAI fundamentals to real‑world applications.

Generative AI refers to models that generate new content — such as text, images, audio, code, and more — by learning patterns from large datasets. These models power modern LLMs, image generators, RAG workflows, and intelligent agent systems.

🧠 What You’ll Learn
📘 Fundamentals

Generative AI Basics — What it is and how it works

LLM Concepts — Architecture, training, and inference

Prompt Engineering — Techniques for better outputs

🛠 Core Guides

RAG Architectures — Retrieval‑Augmented Generation patterns

Vector Embeddings — How embeddings power semantic search

AI Patterns — Chain‑of‑thought, meta‑prompting, hybrid search

🚀 Hands‑On Use Cases

Conversational bots with context memory

Agentic multi‑AI workflows

Cloud and on‑prem GenAI stacks

🔧 Getting Started

This is primarily a documentation and learning resource repository, so no runtime install workflow is required to begin exploring content.

However, if demo scripts or sample notebooks are included in future updates, follow their specific instructions and dependency setups (e.g., virtualenv, Python packages, notebook tools).

📈 Example Use Cases

Here are some of the practical scenarios you’ll find covered:

Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) — building RAG apps with vectors and search indexes

Agentic AI & Orchestration — multi‑agent workflows coordinating tasks

Conversational Systems — chatbots with AI reasoning and memory

Cloud Platform Guides — GenAI on AWS, Azure, Vertex AI

Generative AI spans many domains and applications — from text and image creation to complex agent orchestration. Explore the guides to build real solutions.
